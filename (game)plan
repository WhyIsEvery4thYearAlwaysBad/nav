nav is an executable that helps modify source nav mesh files. It only accepts one file, for sake of easier programming. There is no real drawback anyway.
Commands (I need to work on):

* nav file <file path> 
	
* nav compress ids - Compresses IDs.

FIXED issues:
1. ~~Something is going on here that's screwing up the file stream.~~ God I'm a fucking idiotâ€¦ (actually get TFAttributes)


Todo:

* Use all non-GNU launch options and import them into cmd directly.
* Add helper functions for NavArea and NavCustomData to output their raw data.
* Use filebuffer in std::fstream instead of just using fstream.
* Use file-based messages.
* Get commands from file instead of making them internal.
