# FAQ

## Why did you make this program?

Because there were no other command-line NAV editor tools.

## Why did you use TOML for storing string-datum maps?

TOML is a minimal configuration format, and I feel that it fits best here. JSON is too noisy in syntax, and it can generally be parsed by YAML anyway, so it is redundant.
